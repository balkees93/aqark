            <h1>AQARK</h1>
            <p>AQARK is a leading Commercial Real Estate Development service provider committed to creating futuristic,
                innovative projects. Our diverse projects include residential, commercial & retail. We aim to develop
                stunning
                real estate projects that satisfy the needs of our customers. We offer top-quality yet affordable
                housing in
                the
                most lucrative locations. You can seek us to choose the real estate you want per your budget.

                AQAR was established in 2010 as a subsidiary of Al Khonji Real Estate & Development SAOC. So, what does
                AQAR
                stands for? It is the real estate word in Arabic “عقار.” Our brand identity represents a simple,
                memorable,
                and
                sharp-minded image to the consumer’s mind.

                A professional team with years of experience in property development is leading the business. On the top
                of
                the
                pyramid is Mr. Mohamed Abdulla Al Khonji, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AQAR. He has been
                an
                exceptional inspiration to the rest of the team members working hard to elevate the company’s success.

                Since 1991 Mr. Mohamed and his brother, Qaboos, are etching their names in the Omani Market. They lead
                the
                company with passion and hard work, resulting in success for the business. Integrity, ethics, and
                determination
                to gain new milestones motivate the team to work together to better the brand.

                Industry experience plays a significant role in the real estate sector. With more than a decade’s worth
                of
                experience, AQAR provides top-quality services. We follow a well-planned Real Estate Development Process
                and
                aim
                to deliver projects within the stipulated deadline. Our primary focus has always been to develop
                projects
                where
                people would want to invest and live.
